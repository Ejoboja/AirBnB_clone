	AirBnB clone project

This is  a team project on creating an AirBnB console that is going to be the first step on creating our first web application.
we are going to create a command interpreter that is able to manage the objects of our project, such as, creating a new object, retrieving an object from a file,updating an attribute and/or destroying  an object.
Each task is linked and will help you to:
	put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
	create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
	create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
	create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
	create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
